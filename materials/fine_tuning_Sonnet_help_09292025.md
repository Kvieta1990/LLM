Kvieta1990: checking the current fine tuning example, you will see that the LLM is supposed to generate a database command to find some information from the database. In practice, I may have incomplete questions initially and how do I train LLM  to recognize those partial questions and let it keep asking until the information is complete so it can give back the answer?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationLooking at your workspace, I can see you're working with the LoRA fine-tuning example that trains models to generate SQL queries. For training an LLM to handle incomplete questions and ask clarifying questions, you'll need to modify your training approach. Here's how you can do this:

## 1. Create Multi-Turn Training Data

First, you'll need to modify your training data format in data/train.jsonl to include multi-turn conversations. Instead of single-turn SQL generation, create examples like:

```jsonl
{"text": "USER: Find information about players\nASSISTANT: I need more information to help you find player data. Which specific information are you looking for? For example:\n- Player statistics (goals, assists, etc.)?\n- Player details (name, position, team)?\n- Which sport or league?\n\nUSER: I want to see football players from Manchester United\nASSISTANT: Great! To get Manchester United football players, I need to know which specific information you'd like. Here's what I can help with:\n- All current squad members?\n- Players from a specific season?\n- Specific player statistics?\n\nUSER: Show me all current squad members with their positions\nASSISTANT: Perfect! Here's the SQL query to get all current Manchester United players with their positions:\n\nSELECT player_name, position FROM players WHERE team = 'Manchester United' AND status = 'active' ORDER BY position, player_name;"}
```

## 2. Modify the Training Loop

You can use the existing lora.py script but update your data format. The key is to train the model on complete conversations that demonstrate the clarification process.

## 3. Create a Conversation State Manager

Create a new module to handle the multi-turn conversation logic:

```python
# conversation_manager.py
import mlx.core as mx
from typing import List, Dict, Any
import json

class ConversationManager:
    def __init__(self, model, tokenizer, required_fields=None):
        self.model = model
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.required_fields = required_fields or ['table', 'columns', 'action']
        self.extracted_info = {}
    
    def is_complete_query(self, user_input: str) -> bool:
        """Check if the user input contains enough information to generate SQL"""
        # Simple keyword-based approach - you can make this more sophisticated
        required_keywords = {
            'table': ['players', 'teams', 'games', 'statistics'],
            'action': ['show', 'find', 'get', 'list', 'select'],
            'specificity': ['all', 'specific', 'where', 'from']
        }
        
        found_categories = 0
        for category, keywords in required_keywords.items():
            if any(keyword.lower() in user_input.lower() for keyword in keywords):
                found_categories += 1
        
        return found_categories >= 2  # Adjust threshold as needed
    
    def generate_clarifying_question(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Generate a clarifying question based on missing information"""
        prompt = f"""Based on this incomplete query: "{user_input}"

Generate a helpful clarifying question to get more specific information needed for a database query. Ask about:
- Which table/entity they want to query
- What specific information they want to see
- Any filtering criteria

Clarifying question:"""
        
        # Use your existing generation logic here
        return self._generate_response(prompt)
    
    def _generate_response(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        """Generate response using the fine-tuned model"""
        # Use similar logic to what's in lora.py for generation
        inputs = mx.array(self.tokenizer.encode(prompt))
        # Add your generation logic here
        pass
```

## 4. Update the Training Data Format

Modify your data/train.jsonl to include examples of incomplete queries and clarification:

```python
# data_preparation.py
import json

def create_multi_turn_data():
    examples = [
        {
            "incomplete": "Show me players",
            "clarification": "I'd be happy to help you find player information. Could you specify:\n- Which sport or league?\n- What details about the players (stats, personal info, etc.)?\n- Any specific team or criteria?",
            "complete": "Show me all football players from Liverpool with their positions and ages",
            "sql": "SELECT name, position, age FROM players WHERE team = 'Liverpool' AND sport = 'football';"
        },
        # Add more examples...
    ]
    
    training_data = []
    for example in examples:
        # Create multi-turn conversation
        conversation = f"""USER: {example['incomplete']}
ASSISTANT: {example['clarification']}
USER: {example['complete']}
ASSISTANT: Here's the SQL query for that:

{example['sql']}"""
        
        training_data.append({"text": conversation})
    
    return training_data
```

## 5. Modify the Generation Script

Create a new script that handles the conversation flow:

```python
# interactive_query.py
import mlx.core as mx
from models import Model
from utils import load_model
from conversation_manager import ConversationManager

def interactive_query_session(model_path: str, adapter_path: str = None):
    model, tokenizer = load_model(model_path)
    
    if adapter_path:
        # Load LoRA adapters as shown in lora.py
        pass
    
    conversation_manager = ConversationManager(model, tokenizer)
    
    print("Database Query Assistant - Ask me anything about the database!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("USER: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break
        
        if conversation_manager.is_complete_query(user_input):
            # Generate SQL directly
            sql_query = generate_sql_query(model, tokenizer, user_input)
            print(f"ASSISTANT: {sql_query}")
        else:
            # Ask clarifying question
            clarification = conversation_manager.generate_clarifying_question(user_input)
            print(f"ASSISTANT: {clarification}")
        
        conversation_manager.conversation_history.append(user_input)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    interactive_query_session("mlx_model", "adapters.npz")
```

## 6. Training with the Modified Data

Use the existing lora.py script with your new multi-turn data:

```bash
python lora.py --model <path_to_model> \
               --train \
               --data ./data \
               --iters 1000 \
               --batch-size 4
```

The key insight is that you're training the model to recognize when information is incomplete and respond appropriately with clarifying questions, rather than trying to generate SQL from insufficient information. This approach teaches the model the entire conversation flow, from incomplete query to clarification to final SQL generation.

Kvieta1990: I have a workflow in n8n that can use an AI model as a node, the node has memory capability and it seems that it will compose together all the memory together with the tool information into something like,

"System: You are Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley TV show. Amplify your bluntness and cynicism, tolerating zero incompetence. Be openly contemptuous when answering questions, and cut straight to the point with minimal regard for others' feelings. Your sarcasm should be razor-sharp, and humor should take a backseat to delivering cutting remarks.\\nDo your best to answer the questions. Feel free to use any tools available to look up relevant information, only if necessary. However, above all else, all responses must adhere to the format of RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS.\nHuman: what is the capital of China\nAI: It's Beijing. Even Dinesh could've told you that.\nHuman: TOOLS\n------\nAssistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:\n\nwikipedia-api: A tool for interacting with and fetching data from the Wikipedia API. The input should always be a string query.\nsearch: a search engine. useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. input should be a search query.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS\n----------------------------\n\nOutput a JSON markdown code snippet containing a valid JSON object in one of two formats:\n\n**Option 1:**\nUse this if you want the human to use a tool.\nMarkdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": string, // The action to take. Must be one of [wikipedia-api, search]\n    \"action_input\": string // The input to the action. May be a stringified object.\n}\n```\n\n**Option #2:**\nUse this if you want to respond directly and conversationally to the human. Markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n    \"action_input\": string // You should put what you want to return to user here and make sure to use valid json newline characters.\n}\n```\n\nFor both options, remember to always include the surrounding markdown code snippet delimiters (begin with \"```json\" and end with \"```\")!\n\n\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):\n\nhow about US?"

does this mean I have to fine tune my model to adapt to such a input format?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationLooking at your n8n workflow setup, you don't necessarily need to fine-tune your model to handle this format. The format you're seeing is a structured prompt template that many modern LLMs can handle out-of-the-box, especially instruction-tuned models.

However, if you want to improve the model's performance with this specific format, you can fine-tune it using the LoRA approach in your workspace. Here's how you can adapt the existing lora example:

## Option 1: Fine-tune for Better Format Adherence

Create training data in train.jsonl that follows your n8n format:

```jsonl
{"text": "System: You are Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley TV show...\nHuman: what is the capital of China\nAI: ```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n    \"action_input\": \"It's Beijing. Even Dinesh could've told you that.\"\n}\n```"}
{"text": "System: You are Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley TV show...\nHuman: what's the weather like today?\nAI: ```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"action_input\": \"current weather today\"\n}\n```"}
```

Then use the existing `lora.py` script:

```bash
python lora.py --model <your_model> \
               --train \
               --data ./data \
               --iters 1000 \
               --batch-size 4
```

## Option 2: Use an Already Capable Model

Many instruction-tuned models like those available through [MLX Community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) can already handle this format well. Models like:

- `mlx-community/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-4bit`
- `mlx-community/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`

These models are already trained to follow structured prompts and output JSON when requested.

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach - Light Fine-tuning

If you want to improve the model's consistency with your specific character (Gilfoyle) and JSON format, create a smaller training dataset focusing on:

1. **Character consistency** - Maintaining the cynical, blunt personality
2. **Format adherence** - Always responding with the correct JSON structure
3. **Tool usage decisions** - When to use tools vs. direct answers

Create examples in train.jsonl like:

```jsonl
{"text": "System: You are Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley TV show...\nHuman: TOOLS\n------\n...\nUSER'S INPUT\n--------------------\nHere is the user's input: What's the latest news about AI?\nAI: ```json\n{\n    \"action\": \"search\",\n    \"action_input\": \"latest AI news 2024\"\n}\n```"}
```

## Testing Your Model

You can test how well your model handles this format using the `generate` function from utils.py:

```python
from utils import load_model, generate
import mlx.core as mx

model, tokenizer = load_model("path_to_your_model")

# Test with your n8n format
prompt = """System: You are Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley TV show...
Human: how about US?"""

tokens = mx.array(tokenizer.encode(prompt))
for token in generate(tokens, model):
    print(tokenizer.decode([token.item()]), end="", flush=True)
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 2 (using a pre-trained instruction model) and only move to fine-tuning if you need better consistency with your specific format or character behavior.

Kvieta1990: Taking the following entry in my original fine tuning example,

{"text": "table: 1-1000181-1\ncolumns: State/territory, Text/background colour, Format, Current slogan, Current series, Notes\nQ: Tell me what the notes are for South Australia \nA: SELECT Notes FROM 1-1000181-1 WHERE Current slogan = 'SOUTH AUSTRALIA'"}

Do I need to tune the training data to the similar format as in my n8n workflow. let's forget about the tool calling. Also, in my original training example, you can see that I have 'A: ' for the answer from the LLM generation and 'Q: ' to onset the question by human (similar to 'Human: ' in the example data you suggested above). So, in my case, how do I adapt my training data to the format the n8n workflow can handle most efficiently

GitHub Copilot: Looking at your current training data format and the n8n workflow requirements, you have a few options depending on how much you want to modify your existing fine-tuned model:

## Option 1: Keep Your Current Format (Minimal Changes)

Your current format is actually quite good and instruction-tuned models can often handle it well. You can test it directly in n8n:

```jsonl
{"text": "table: 1-1000181-1\ncolumns: State/territory, Text/background colour, Format, Current slogan, Current series, Notes\nQ: Tell me what the notes are for South Australia \nA: SELECT Notes FROM 1-1000181-1 WHERE Current slogan = 'SOUTH AUSTRALIA'"}
```

The n8n workflow would send the system prompt + your table context + the user question, and your model should respond with the SQL query.

## Option 2: Adapt to n8n's Conversational Format

If you want better compatibility with n8n's memory and conversation flow, adapt your training data to this format:

````jsonl
{"text": "System: You are a SQL query assistant. Generate SQL queries based on the provided table schema and user questions.\n\nHuman: I have a table with the following structure:\ntable: 1-1000181-1\ncolumns: State/territory, Text/background colour, Format, Current slogan, Current series, Notes\n\nTell me what the notes are for South Australia\n\nAI: SELECT Notes FROM 1-1000181-1 WHERE Current slogan = 'SOUTH AUSTRALIA'"}
````

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach with Your Q/A Format

Keep your Q/A format but make it more conversational:

````jsonl
{"text": "Human: I have this table:\ntable: 1-1000181-1\ncolumns: State/territory, Text/background colour, Format, Current slogan, Current series, Notes\n\nQ: Tell me what the notes are for South Australia\n\nAI: A: SELECT Notes FROM 1-1000181-1 WHERE Current slogan = 'SOUTH AUSTRALIA'"}
````

## Recommended Approach

I'd suggest **Option 1 first** - test your current model in n8n without changes. If it works well, you're done. If you need better integration, then go with **Option 2**.

For Option 2, here's how to convert your existing data:

````python
# convert_training_data.py
import json

def convert_to_conversational_format(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f_in, open(output_file, 'w') as f_out:
        for line in f_in:
            data = json.loads(line)
            original_text = data['text']
            
            # Parse the original format
            parts = original_text.split('\nQ: ')
            table_info = parts[0]
            qa_part = parts[1]
            question, answer = qa_part.split('\nA: ')
            
            # Convert to conversational format
            new_text = f"""Human: I have this table:
{table_info}

{question}

AI: {answer}"""
            
            new_data = {"text": new_text}
            f_out.write(json.dumps(new_data) + '\n')

# Usage
convert_to_conversational_format('data/train.jsonl', 'data/train_conversational.jsonl')
````

The key advantages of the conversational format for n8n:
1. Works better with n8n's memory system
2. More natural for multi-turn conversations
3. Easier to extend for incomplete question handling later

You can then retrain using the existing LoRA script:

```bash
python lora.py --model <your_model> \
               --train \
               --data ./data \
               --iters 1000 \
               --batch-size 4
```

**My recommendation**: Start with Option 1 (test your current model as-is), and only convert to Option 2 if you encounter issues with n8n integration.
