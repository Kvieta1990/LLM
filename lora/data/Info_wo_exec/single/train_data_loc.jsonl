{"text": "Scope: Data access\nCategory: Experimentation\nQ: Where do I find my data on NOMAD?\nA: For a specific IPTS (here, I will be using '12345' as an example), the reduced data can be found at `/SNS/NOM/IPTS-12345/shared/autoreduce/single_bank_summed`. The reduced data in Q- (in the normalized `S(Q)` format) and r- (the pair distribution function in the pdffit `G(r)` format) space can be found in their dedicated folders. The input files used for the data processing together with reduction logs can also be found in their dedicated folders under the directory. There are several assumptions coming with the reduced data, as they come from the autoreduction routine. First, the autoreduction would assume some dummy sample composition if such information is unavailable at run time. Using such dummy composition information is not going to impact the total scattering pattern fundamentally but it will have a strong impact on the data scaling. Second, with the dummy composition, the absorption correction could not be performed accurately. Therefore, if the sample under consideration is with strong neutron absorption, attention needs to be paid for the autoreduced data. Third, a default cutoff value of 1.0 angstrom is used for the Fourier filter, so some necessary post-processing may be needed to filter out the low-r range garbage signal beyond the default cutoff of 1.0 angstrom. Fourth, data included in this directory is for the scenario where the pattern from all detectors are summed/focused together, regardless of the different resolution for detectors with different scattering angle.\n\nConcerning the fourth point here, the autoreduction also implements another routine for the data reduction -- the `multiple-banks` mode. The idea is to reduce the data into multiple groups of detectors, and detectors in each group are with similar scattering angle (thus similar resolution). The focused data from those groups will then be merged together to yield the overall total scattering pattern, followed by the Fourier transform to give the PDF pattern. For the merging, the principle is to use as much the data coming from the high resolution group (i.e., high scattering angle) as possible. Low resolution bank data will only be used when the low Q region of the data are not available in the high resolution banks. The connection between adjacent banks to be included in the merged pattern is non-overlapping and seamless. The reduced group-by-group data can be found at `/SNS/NOM/IPTS-12345/shared/autoreduce/multi_banks_summed`. Concerning the output in this regard, first, not only the total scattering data are included, but also the Bragg diffraction data are included as well, in GSAS (see the `GSAS_unnorm` folder) and Topas (see the `Topas_unnorm`) output format. Again, each type of data is included in their dedicated folders. Second, the output from the autoreduction routine for total scattering will stop at the group-by-group stage (in the `S(Q)` folder) and for the following data merging, we have to do that manually."}
