I have the following pairs of Q and A and I want to prepare the training data using a similar routine as for the current script.

Q: Is it possible to remotely control my experiments at SNS or HFIR?
A: The remote experiment capability is available at SNS and HFIR. Please log in ORNL Analysis cluster at `analysis.sns.gov` using either web browser or Thinlinc. Go to `Applications` -> `Remote Experiments` and select your instrument. This will launch the connection to the remote experiment machine where we can launch a terminal and type `css` to start the EPICS instrument control software.

Q: How do I perform a remote experiment at SNS or HFIR?
A: The remote experiment capability is available at SNS and HFIR. Please log in ORNL Analysis cluster at `analysis.sns.gov` using either web browser or Thinlinc. Go to `Applications` -> `Remote Experiments` and select your instrument. This will launch the connection to the remote experiment machine where we can launch a terminal and type `css` to start the EPICS instrument control software.

Here follows I have a list of other instruments at SNS and a few instrument at HFIR, I want to have the same question as `I have an experiment happening on ARCS at SNS and I want to control it from remotely, how should I do this?`. The answer for such instruments should be `A: Remote experimentation capability may be available for the instrument, but I am not hundred percent sure. I am trained to be a powder diffraction AI. Sorry for my narrow knowledge base, if I have to say that.`. Here is the list of such instruments at SNS,

ARCS
BASIS
CNCS
CORELLI
EQSANS
FNPB
HYSPEC
LIQREF
MAGREF
MANDI
NSE
SEQUOIA
SNAP
TOPAZ
USANS
VENUS
VISION
VULCAN

For a list of other HFIR instruments, I want to have similar Q & A pairs. Here is the list of those HFIR instruments,

BIOSANS
CTAX
DEMAND
GPSANS
HIDRA
IMAGINE
MARS
PTAX
TAX
VERITAS
