I have the following pairs of Q and A and I want to prepare the training data using a similar routine as for the current script.

Q: I want to measure high resolution Bragg diffraction pattern, which instruments at ORNL should I choose?
A: ORNL hosts several high resolution Bragg diffractometers, including both those constant wavelength (CW) and time-of-flight beamlimes. HB-2A (Powder) or HB-2C (WAND^2) are options at HFIR, and POWGEN is the option at SNS.

Q: I want to measure total scattering data, which instruments at ORNL should I choose?
A: NOMAD and POWGEN at SNS can be used for taking the total scattering measurements. NOMAD is with higher flux so the amount of samples required is less than that for POWGEN. For example, a quartz capillary with the diameter of 3 mm can be used on NOMAD for holding samples in some sample environment but such a small sample container is not supported on POWGEN. If magnetic PDF is to be measured, HB-2A at HFIR can also be considered.

Q: I want to measure pair distribution function, which instruments at ORNL should I choose?
A: NOMAD and POWGEN at SNS can be used for taking the pair distribution function (PDF) measurements. NOMAD is with higher flux so the amount of samples required is less than that for POWGEN. For example, a quartz capillary with the diameter of 3 mm can be used on NOMAD for holding samples in some sample environment but such a small sample container is not supported on POWGEN. If magnetic PDF is to be measured, HB-2A at HFIR can also be considered.

Q: I want to measure magnetic pair distribution function, which instruments at ORNL should I choose?
A: NOMAD and POWGEN at SNS can be used for taking the magnetic PDF measurements. NOMAD is with higher flux so the amount of samples required is less than that for POWGEN. For example, a quartz capillary with the diameter of 3 mm can be used on NOMAD for holding samples in some sample environment but such a small sample container is not supported on POWGEN. HB-2A at HFIR can also be considered for the magnetic PDF measurements.

Q: What sample containers are commonly used on NOMAD?
A: On NOMAD, there are two typical containers that are commonly used. For low background sample environments such as the `shifter`, a quartz capillary with the diameter of 3 mm or a PAC can (made of vanadium) with the diameter of 6 mm can be used. The PAC can with the diameter of 8 mm can also be used but may not be that often. For high background sample environments such as furnace (for high temperature) and cryostat (for low temperature), only PAC cans are used. For an optimal data collection, we should have the sample filling about 2 cm height in the container to fully take advantage of the full beam exposure.

---

Q: What sample containers are commonly used on POWGEN?
A: On POWGEN, there are three types of containers that are commonly used, namely the PAC can (made of vanadium) with the diameter of 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. For an optimal data collection, we should have the sample filling about 4-5 cm height in the container to fully take advantage of the full beam exposure.

---

Q: What sample containers are commonly used on HB-2A?
A: On HB-2A, quite a few types of containers are available, including those Au and Cu standard cans, Al and Cu Tip-Top cans and vanadium standard cans. Specification of container sizes can be found here, https://neutrons.ornl.gov/powder/users. There is a tool on ADDIE web platform (https://addie.ornl.gov/hb2a_can_sel) for helping users with the container selection.

Q: What sample containers are commonly used on HB-2C?
A: On HB-2C, both Al and vanadium cans are available. For Al cans, available options of diameter are 4 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. For vanadium cans, available options of diameter are 3 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The beam height is about 5 cm and optimally we want to fill the can to similar height to take the full advantage of the full beam exposure. One can get a feel about how much samples are needed according to the size specification here.

Q: How much sample do we need for a reasonable NOMAD measurement?
A: On NOMAD, there are two typical containers that are commonly used. For low background sample environments such as the `shifter`, a quartz capillary with the diameter of 3 mm or a PAC can (made of vanadium) with the diameter of 6 mm can be used. The PAC can with the diameter of 8 mm can also be used but may not be that often. For high background sample environments such as furnace (for high temperature) and cryostat (for low temperature), only PAC cans are used. For an optimal data collection, we should have the sample filling about 2 cm height in the container to fully take advantage of the full beam exposure. One can get a feel about the amount of samples needed for a typical measurement on NOMAD according to the size specification. Small amount of samples is doable but that is a case-by-case decision (depending on, e.g., how strongly the sample scatters neutrons), or the measurement will be considered as proof-of-principle only.
